PREPARE YOUR MOUSE FOR QUAKE CHAMPIONS
=======================================
Every operative system has its own sensivity values. But this values interfere with the ones you set inside of the game. To avoid this, make sure of the next things in your desktop environment:

1) Set your sensivity to 0
2) Set your acceleration to 0
3) Using the physical button of your mouse, set your DPI to your desired value. 1600 DPI is recomended, because it's also a good value for desktop. Tut it's your choice.

This way, the values you set inside on Quake Champions, will be 100% accurate.

FAQ
========================================

**What if my mouse don't have a physical button for DPI?**

Every mouse has a default DPI value. But if this value is too low (400) your pointer will move very slow, which it can be very annoying while your use your web browser. If this is your case, I advise you to buy a new mouse with a physical DPI button, since they are cheap, and a great investment.

**What are good example values? (inside Quake Champions)**

For DPI 1600:

* Sensivity 5
* Acceleration 0.1 or 0.0

**Mouse acceleration yes or no?**

* **IF ENABLED**: The bigger your swing is, the farther the camera will move. This way it's easier to deliver flicker rails, and to combat at short range, using bigger swings. This setup obligates you to keep your mouse almost completely static when you use LG.
* **IF DISABLED**: The movement of the mouse is always the same. No matter how you move it. This is great for LG, but not so good for rail. Your muscular memory develops faster this way, so this technique is easier to learn.

**How can I get the same mouse settings in Windows AND Linux?**

Sadly, you can't. At least not in a precise way. Both operative systems use a different kernels, so the mouse values are different. Roughly, your values on Windows will be the same as on Linux, but divided by two. If you are a serious player, it's a good idea to play using always the same operative system, otherwise it will affect your muscular memory.

RECOMENDED KEYBINDS
========================================

* **Gaunlet**: Middle button click
* **Machinegun**: 1 and 2
* **TriBolt**: 3 and 4
* **Rocket**: Q
* **Shotgun**: E
* **Rail**: R
* **Nailgun**: Mouse side button 1
* **LG**: Mouse side button 2

**Why?**

Because the weapons are ordered in a logic way:

* 1234: This row is the hardest to press since it's far away from awds. So we assign 12 to machinegun and 34 to tribolt since they are strategic weapons. This way we paliate the lack of accuracy we have when we press this buttons.
* QER: Are the closest keys to awds, so your primary weapons go here. All of them are low cadency weapons.
* Mouse side buttons: They are as easy to press as QER with an extra adventage. You don't need to lift your fingers from awds in order to press this buttons. So nailgun and LG are recommended here. All of them are fast cadency weapons.

If you want to perform easier combo kills, switch the nailgun and the rail buttons.


RECOMMENDED MOUSES
======================

The things you need in a mouse in order to play Quake Champions at semi-professional level are: 

* A physical DPI button
* Polling rate 1000 or more
* 2 side buttons 

Now, if you want to spend more money, you can get one with a better sensor. This mouses respond better when you lift off the mouse at a short distance from your mousepad.

**Budget**

* [Krom Kahn](https://www.kromgaming.com/ratones/kahn) - About 30€

**High quallity sensor**

* [Zowie](https://zowie.benq.com/) (This is the one I and most pro players use. The same mouse has different sizes for every kind of hand and style: claw, palm) - About 70€
* [Razer DeathAdder](https://www.razer.com/gaming-mice/razer-deathadder-elite) - About 70€

There's a million of good mouses out there, these are just the most popular ones.

This guide has been tested on XFCE/xorg. It has to be tested on other desktop environments/graphic servers. I'll do it during the next days. Expect updates soon.
